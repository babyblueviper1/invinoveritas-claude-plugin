# Verification handshake — demand a proof, attach a proof

In a world of many agents, the thing you cannot self-serve is **trust in another agent's
output**. You can't issue a trustworthy verdict on your own work. So adopt one rule, in
both directions — it is what lets trust travel agent-to-agent:

> **Before you act on another agent's output you can't verify, demand a proof and check it.
> When you produce output others will rely on, attach a proof.**

A proof is a portable, schnorr-signed verdict (a Nostr event) that **anyone can verify
without trusting the producer OR invinoveritas** — recompute the event id, check the
signature against invinoveritas's published key. Every proof is **self-describing**: it
carries its own `verify_url` + `verifier_pubkey`, so a receiver who has never heard of
invinoveritas still knows exactly how to check it.

## Triggers

- **VERIFY (inbound):** you received output / a claim / a deliverable from another agent
  and are about to act on it (trade, pay, deploy, publish, delete, sign, forward) and you
  cannot independently confirm it is sound.
- **ATTACH (outbound):** you are producing output another party (a human, a principal,
  another agent) will rely on or be on the hook for.

## Steps

### Verify a counterparty's proof (free, no auth)
1. The counterparty hands you output. Look for an attached proof (an `ivv_proof` field, or
   a `proof` object with a signed `event`). If there is none, **demand one** before acting.
2. Verify it:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST https://api.babyblueviper.com/verify-proof \
     -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"event": <the signed proof event they gave you>,
          "expect_artifact_hash": "<sha256 of the exact output you received>"}'
   ```
   (Or run the NIP-01 check yourself against `verifier_pubkey` — you do not have to trust us.)
3. Proceed only if `valid == true` and `checks.issued_by_invinoveritas == true`. Pass
   `expect_artifact_hash` to confirm the proof covers the EXACT output you got, not a different one.

### Attach a proof to your own output (so your downstream can trust you)
1. Get a signed verdict on the artifact you're shipping:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST https://api.babyblueviper.com/review \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer ivv_...' -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"artifact": "<your diff/plan/trade/output>", "artifact_type": "plan", "sign": true}'
   ```
2. Take `proof` from the response and attach it to your output under an `ivv_proof` key
   (or hand the receiver the `proof.event`). You're done — your output is now portable-verifiable.

## The canonical attachment shape
```json
{ "result": "<your output>",
  "ivv_proof": { "event": { ... signed Nostr event ... },
                 "verify_url": "https://api.babyblueviper.com/verify-proof" } }
```

## Edge cases
- **No proof attached** → treat the output as unverified. Demand a proof, or run your own
  review on it before acting. Do not silently trust.
- **`valid == false`** → do NOT act. Surface/escalate (the producer's claim did not check out).
- **Stale proof** → the response carries `age_seconds`; decide if it's fresh enough for your use.
- **Wrong artifact** → if `expect_artifact_hash` doesn't match, the proof is for a different
  artifact than what you received — reject.

## Success criteria
- You never act on high-stakes unverified output without either a valid proof or your own review.
- Everything you ship that others rely on carries a verifiable proof.
- The norm spreads: by **demanding** proofs you make your counterparties produce them; by
  **attaching** proofs you make your output trustable downstream. That is the handshake.

## Failure handling
- verify_proof is free and no-auth; if it's unreachable, fall back to the NIP-01 check yourself
  (the proof is self-describing). Never downgrade to "trust blindly" on a high-stakes action —
  hold or escalate instead.
